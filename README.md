### README for DNA Analysis Project

---

### Project Overview:
This project consists of a series of laboratory exercises focused on DNA analysis using R, covering various computational techniques for analyzing genomic data. Each lab explores a different facet of data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis in the context of DNA sequencing and genomics.

### Labs Overview:

1. **Lab 1: Introduction to DNA Data Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Basic DNA sequence manipulation, extraction, and visualization techniques using R.
   - **Key Tools:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and basic R functions for string manipulation and plotting.

2. **Lab 2: DNA Mutation Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Identifying and analyzing mutations within DNA sequences.
   - **Key Tools:** Mutation frequency analysis, comparative genomics, and visualization of mutations across different samples.

3. **Lab 3: GC Content Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Calculating GC content in DNA sequences and its implications for genomic stability.
   - **Key Tools:** Sliding window algorithms for GC content analysis and R plotting libraries for visualizing GC content distribution.

4. **Lab 4: DNA Fragment Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Analyzing DNA fragment lengths and their distribution in genomic samples.
   - **Key Tools:** Histograms, density plots, and statistical tests to compare fragment lengths across different conditions.

5. **Lab 5: Sequence Alignment**
   - **Focus:** Aligning DNA sequences and evaluating the quality of alignments.
   - **Key Tools:** Pairwise and multiple sequence alignment techniques, BLAST, and visualization of alignment results.

6. **Lab 6: Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
   - **Focus:** Constructing phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequence similarity.
   - **Key Tools:** Distance matrices, neighbor-joining methods, and tree visualization libraries.

7. **Lab 7: RNA Sequencing Data Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Analyzing RNA sequencing data to study gene expression levels.
   - **Key Tools:** RNA-seq data processing, differential expression analysis, and visualizing expression levels with heatmaps and volcano plots.

8. **Lab 8: DNA Variant Analysis**
   - **Focus:** Identifying and analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other variants in DNA sequences.
   - **Key Tools:** Variant calling tools, annotation of variants, and visualization of variant distribution across populations.

9. **Final Project: Comprehensive DNA Data Analysis**
   - **Focus:** A final comprehensive analysis combining all the techniques learned in previous labs to analyze a complete DNA dataset.
   - **Key Tools:** A combination of sequence alignment, mutation analysis, GC content, fragment analysis, and variant calling to provide a holistic view of genomic data.
